        <p><b>ABOUT ME</b> </p>
        <p> I am forever optimistic, work hard, and love new adventures! Graphic design is my passion, and I also love photography, music and travel. I     strive to consistently learn new creative skills to achieve my personal and professional goalsâ€”I'm currently working towards a master's degree in computer science, and a certificate in UX Design. I have a wide array of professional and life experience that has shaped the person I am today: adaptable, patient, creative, energetic, and ready to jump in with both feet!
